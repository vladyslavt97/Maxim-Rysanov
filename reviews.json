Rysanov’s nuanced phrasing and excellent variety of tone colour would present a challenge for some actual singers to match, and Kim’s piano playing is a special joy. The best Lieder pianists can establish a magical atmosphere of raptness and longing from the very first note of Dichterliebe, and he is to the manner born. It’s wonderful to find a recording like this; one that, as soon as it finishes, you want to start it all over again.",
